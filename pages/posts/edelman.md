*Vue SPA showcasing selected airbnb locations as part of a campaing to increase tourism to the Hawaiin Islands*

### TJmaxx Maxx You
I built this static SPA microsite as part of a campaign for TJmaxx. Built with Vue.js, AWS S3, and deployed with Heroku.

These are some of the high-impact, high visibility projects that I worked on. I also worked on a variety of smaller projects and tasks such as:

- writing a node webscraper to update and reformat content from the legacy Citi group blog to the new Citi group blog
- setup and configure a VR experience for a biotech company at a showcase event
- built a couple quick/simple MEVN apps such as a questionnaire app, a simple stopwatch app, an app for detecting baldness, and a site showcasing recent internal promotions.
- occational maintenance and updates to the Edelman Digital wordpress website.
