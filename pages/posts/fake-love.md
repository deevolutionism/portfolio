I had the opportunity to help the team at Fake Love (aquired by NYT) finalize development for a multiscreen interactive dashboard built to showcase Nokia Bell Labs Future X concept.

The experience included a multi screen display and a web app that allowed users to interact and configure various 5G network technologies. The app would display the affect on KPIs (key performance indicators) in real time. 

I was responsible for developing the custom charts and graphs on the right-hand pannel that reacted to the user defined network configurations. I built the charts using SVG.js, building a system for dynamically generating the charts based on the data provided by the backend. The system included features such as animating data transitions, custom legend, and styles.

> "Using the laboratory, enterprise customers of the company’s newly announced Future X for industries strategy and architecture will be able to envision how slicing, fine-tuning and making changes to their industrial networks will help them achieve their goals. Need less latency in a robotic task? The network will adapt for that. Need more speed for another task? The network will adapt."

> "First they’ll sit down in a futuristic network control center and see what tweaks can be made to change their productivity outcomes. Then, they’ll virtually tour a simulated factory floor that harnesses industrial-IoT, distributed-cloud, augmented-intelligence (AI), augmented-reality, virtual-reality and high-performance networking, including advanced LTE and 5G."
