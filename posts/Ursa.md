## URSA, A Sustainable Shopping XR Companion App

Ursa was a ðŸ”— MIT Reality Virtually 2019 Hackathon project developed in colaboration with an amazing team that included XR dev [Tejas](https://www.tejasshroff.com/about/), design & strategy [Mischa](http://www.mischacreates.com/), producer Dan Cole, design rx Margot Lieblich, and myself. 

We created a prototype AR app with the goal of helping shoppers make sustainable purchasing decisions. We used PTC Vuforia to recognize different products on a shelf and then display a quick and easy meta data as a buy/sell signal to the user. Healthy for you, healthy for the planet!
