## CitizenDAO Impact Protocol

### NFT social impact marketplace concept for funding project development
---
As part of my web3 exploration journey, I decided joining a hackathon would be a good environment to get down and dirty. My objective was to learn some basic tools and fundamental concepts for interacting with a blockchain as well as learn more about the community and ecosystem. 

[EthGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) looked like a good opportunity with access to a global community. Specifcally i joined the [Eth Online 2021](https://online.ethglobal.com/) cohort that included a prize pool worth over $300k sponsored by tons of startups. The basic format was to:

1. Apply (and get accepted).
2. Create a profile stating interests experience level, skills, and project ideas (if any).
3. Form teams.
4. Hack!
5. Pitch and submit.

All this was coordinated 100% virtually with the help of discord, zoom, youtube, twitch, google drive, their hackathon dashboard, and of course their fantastic team.

Brennan Hodge reached out to me to join his team working on [CitizenDAO](https://citizendao.com). I accepted. The teams goal was to see if the Ethereum ecosystem could be leveraged to help solve some of the worlds largest problems identified by the [United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). Specifically, could NFTs be used for more than speculative PFP (profile picture) projects and have measurable real world impact? Could we bootstrap a DAO to achieve the goals of the UN? Quite a tall order; a moonshot.

Since the launch of [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) on Ethereum back in 2018 and an initial surge of excitement generated by[cyrptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), then Cryptopunks, etc. There's been a cambrian explosion of NFT projects ranging from PFP (profile pictures) to game items, access passes, POAPs, claims on land (real and virtual), and more. Could NFTs be used for social good, too?

Drawing inspiration from [retroactive public goods funding](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html), [Gitcoin Grants](), and tradition web2 crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe and Kickstarter, we set out to prototype some ideas. More or less, could we build a decentalized GoFundMe where projects are submitted, curated, and funded entirely by emergent communities?
