I had the great honor to work alongside my very talented prior coworker from Edelman Digital, [Christopher Miles](https://christophermil.es/about), who brought me on board to help finish up a really cool interactive data visualization project for Bell Labs lead by the folks at Fake Love (aquired by NYT). 

Future X was an immersive interactive experience exhibited at the historic Bell Labs campus located in New Jersey. The goal was to walk guests through a multi room exhibit that demonstrates how a variety of 5G technologies might affect the overall operating cost and efficiency of a future city. 

My task was to develop the charts that dynamically visualizaed how 5G technology configuration changes might affect operating costs and various performance metrics.

For this project I leveraged the svg.js library because it offered a greater degree of freedom compared to existing charting frameworks, which were too limited considering the style and animations required for this project.
