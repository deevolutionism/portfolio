### Installation

I joined Ekene Ijeoma as a production assistant for an early verison of Heartfelt, an interactive experience showcased at the 2019 Panorama Music Festival. I was on the team responsible for installation of the project, which included assembly/disasembly of hardware, wiring, flashing microcontrollers, and testing. It took about a month of work to manufacture and test the assembly, and then about 2-3 days to assemle the project on site at the festival!

> "Heartfelt by Ekene Ijeoma is an installation in which participants hold hands and let electricity flow through them to turn on lights and play sounds. It all sounds pretty trippy, and surely more memorable than another Boomerang or tweet."
